Node is faster than browser, as it use c++ api bindings to run

Install nodejs
install python 2.7 and make it as default in env path for some time (required for next step to work)
Ref for more info: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node
yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder

After done installing packages, you can change the python back to 3 in env variables path (it's better to keep python 2 in path until you are done with coding, because installing new tensorflow-node packages may require the python 2 in path)

In script you can add:

use = require('@tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder');
tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');
# The below line is added to get the fast c++ api
require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');


run the scrpt using: node scriptname.js

If you have nvidia gpu(which is supported by tensorflow), install tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu version instead of tensorflow/tfjs-node
