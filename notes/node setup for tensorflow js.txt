Node is faster than browser, as it use c++ api bindings to run

Install nodejs
npm install --global windows-build-tools  (it will take long time to install, usually this is installed when node get's install, but if it doesn't happen, then install using this command)
install python 2.7 and make it as default in env path for some time (required for next step to work)
Ref for more info: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node
https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/tfjs-node/WINDOWS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow/tfjs-node @tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder

After done installing packages, you can change the python back to 3 in env variables path (it's better to keep python 2 in path until you are done with coding, because installing new tensorflow-node packages may require the python 2 in path)

In script you can add:

use = require('@tensorflow-models/universal-sentence-encoder');
tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs');
# The below line is added to get the fast c++ api
require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');


run the scrpt using: node scriptname.js

If you have nvidia gpu(which is supported by tensorflow), install tensorflow/tfjs-node-gpu version instead of tensorflow/tfjs-node
